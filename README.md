Select Yes for the next option and wait until installation is complete, once you get the complete box you must unmount the ISO or it will cycle through the boot process again:  <br/>
At the top bar of the Virtualbox go to Devices -> Optical Drives -> select your pfsense ISO -> Click Force Unmount <br/>

<br />
Create and install another virtual machine for Linux or Windows whichever you prefer (I used Linux)  <br/>
Edit the adapter 1 to be Attached to Internal Network and launch the new VM <br/>
Open the command line and type ifconfig (linux) or ipconfig (windows) <br/>
Check to see that the inet ip matches your LAN ip thats on PFsense

You can try to ping the LAN ip in the command line to see if you get a response back <br/>

<br/>
Open a web browser and type in the LAN ip, you will get a warning since there is no certificate, you can just ignore that an advance <br/>
